# MyReads Project

The MyReads app provides a simple way to find new books and track your latest reads.

## How It Works

If it's your first time using the app, start by adding some new books to your bookshelf. Here's how:

    1. Click the + icon in the lower right corner.
    2. Enter a query into the search bar. (Be sure to only search queries included in SEARCH_TERMS.md.)
    3. Click the down arrow next to the book you want to read.
    4. Select the appropriate option from the dropdown.
    5. Selecting "currently reading", "want to read", or "read" will add the book to the corresponding shelf. Selecting "none" will remove the book from your bookshelf.
